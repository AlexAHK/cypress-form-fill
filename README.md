# cypress-form-fill

1) Clone this repo

2) From local terminal or command line, install packages
eg type "npm install"

3) To run Cypress the first time, type "npm run cypress:open"

4) The test runner should open shortly.  Switch to the test runner.  You will see a lot of test files that are examples included with cypress.  Make sure the browser selected is Chrome.  Click on "form-fill.spec.js" to run it (see image).

5) The test should run automatically and when it is finished you should see that the test(s) passed (see image below) with green check marks on the left-hand side.

Note:
There is an oddity in the test runner if you move your mouse to the left sidebar (over the previous actions) after the test finishes.  I'm not really worried about it because the test passes, and I think it's not relevant for the assignment.  I am just mentioning it.

After the test passes:
